      <p>Erling Armin Dukerschein Jr. was born in 1957 in Portland, Maine to Erling and Betty Dukerschein. He has
one sister, Kathy Grzanich nee Dukerschein. When Earl was very young the family moved to Waukeegan,
IL where he grew up. Following high school, Earl attended the College of Lake County for two years and
then transferred to Northern Illinois University. He graduated with a major in Computer Science and a
minor in Economics.</p>
<p>Out of college Earl worked a number of small jobs designing programs for businesses. One summer, he
worked for the McDonalds corporate headquarters where he was able to briefly meet the founder of
the company. He was impressed by the building which housed its own bank as well as the only
McDonald’s restaurant in the United States that could legally sell beer and wine. He also worked
extensively on a number of jobs with COBOL.</p>
<p>It was at one of Earl’s early jobs that he met his future wife Cindy. Shortly after he moved to a
company called Fiat Credit. After their marriage, the two determined that they would move back to
Wisconsin to be closer to Cindy’s family as well as members of Earl’s extended family. Cindy’s father
worked for the City of Madison, so Earl decided to try to get a job with the local government as well.
After taking the highest level exam and placing in the top 5, he got a position with the University of
Wisconsin in the Medical Science Center as an administrator. Earl stayed with the University of
Wisconsin until his retirement in 2020.</p>
